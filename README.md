# Portfolio


## Synopsis


This website is an **online portfolio** about me; Mark Winkler.
It contains information on my past and current experiences,
as well as my motivation for the future. All built with
pure `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `JavaScript ES6`.
Please enjoy!


## Development

Original idea with simple wireframes.

For Mobile:

<img src="(https://github.com/MarkWinkler/MarkWinkler.github.io/blob/master/images/Mobile-Wireframe.jpg" width="572">


For Desktop:

<img src="(https://github.com/MarkWinkler/MarkWinkler.github.io/blob/master/images/Desktop-wireframe.jpg" width="572">


## Tests

### Markdown testing
One particular challenge was making the images work in the mardown.
First I used normal markdown syntax:
`![Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/MarkWinkler/MarkWinkler.github.io/blob/master/images/Mobile-Wireframe.jpg)`
This seemed to do the trick, only it was making the images larger despite my commits, where I specifically made 
the images smaller.

To overcome this I have looked online and found forum posts stating that HTML works withink GiTHubs Readme file.
So I went ahead and changed the syntax to the following:
`<img src="(https://github.com/MarkWinkler/MarkWinkler.github.io/blob/master/images/Mobile-Wireframe.jpg" width="572">`
The width directly corresponds to the actual widht of the image.

### HTML and CSS testing
