        <p>
          I was born in Budapest, Hungary and have moved to England over a decade ago. I am
          currently completing my final year of Computer Science studies and pursuing a
          rewarding graduate position from the middle of 2018. I have held many different
          jobs to support my studies, but the most relevant one was the year-long internship
          with General Motors during my third year of University. Currently, I am employed
          part-time as a Web Developer for LASA.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experiences in working within a global team, experience in project management,
          process optimisation, requirement gathering, working with critical systems and
          programming in various programming languages and web development including
          <strong>C, Java, Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.</strong>
